//RPS-game

//Use getComputerChoice function for random choice return. Use console log to make sure it works properly

//Write a function for one round game with playerSelection and computerSelection parameters.
//This function will return something like: "Haha you lose! Rock beats paper!"
    //Make sure player selection is case-insensitive 
    //Make sure your function return results, not console.log it

//Write game() function. Use all functions inside this one. 5 games, keep scores and return a winner or looser based on 5 rounds on the end
    //Try implement loop, tho you don't know how :D
    //Use console.log to display results of each round and the winner at the end

//Use prompt() to get input


//Basic structure game()
    //repeat this 5 times. Remember every round results. Define a winner.
        //One round function. Compare two results. Somehow define who is a winner
            //player choose on of the strings (if statement)
            //return playerSelection
            //-------
            //getComputerChoice(): computer choose a random string (How?)
            //return computerSelection










/* 1. Understand exact problem. Refactor the problem, unless you could explain it in simple English to anyone.
2. Plan a solving. 
    - Does your program have a user interface? what will ot look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch it!
    - What inputs will your program have? User input data or from somewhere else?
    - What's the desired output?
    - Given your inputs, what are the steps to return the desired output?
3. Pseudocode. Write a program in a simple words. */
